    "\ud83d\udca1 Use 'man command' to read the manual for any command",
    "\ufffd Forgot sudo? Type 'sudo !!' to re-run your last command with sudo privileges. Game changer!",
    "\ud83d\udca1 Press Ctrl+R to search your command history interactively. Start typing and watch the magic happen.",
    "\u26a1 Use 'cd -' to jump back to your previous directory instantly. No more retyping long paths!",
    "\ud83c\udfaf 'Ctrl+A' jumps to the start of a line, 'Ctrl+E' to the end. Your fingers will thank you.",
    "\ud83d\udd25 Made a typo? 'Ctrl+U' clears everything before the cursor. 'Ctrl+K' clears after.",
    "\ud83d\udcaa 'mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3' creates nested directories in one shot. No need for multiple commands.",
    "\ud83c\udfa8 'ls -lth' shows files sorted by time (newest first). Add 'head' to see just the latest: ls -lth | head",
    "\u23f1\ufe0f Use 'time {command}' to see exactly how long any command takes. Great for optimization!"
